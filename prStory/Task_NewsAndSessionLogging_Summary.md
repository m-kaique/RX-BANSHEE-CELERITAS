# Task: NewsAndSessionLogging
**Date:** 2025-06-14 03:10 UTC

## Problem
Lack of detailed logs when trading was blocked by session start delays or scheduled news windows made troubleshooting difficult.

## Solution
Added informative logging:
- `ParseTradingSessions` and `ParseNewsTimes` now log configured windows.
- `IsTradingSession` records state transitions (outside, waiting delay, active).
- `IsNewsTime` logs when entering or exiting a news window.
- Removed repeated log in `OnTick` to avoid spam.
These additions follow the guide's recommendation to maintain a disciplined routine and monitor news events (lines around 3350-3380 and 4109).

## Code (snippet)
```mql5
if(state!=lastState && g_log)
    g_log.Log(LOG_INFO,"Trading session active");

if(inNews!=last && g_log)
    g_log.Log(LOG_INFO,"News window active");
```

## Manual Testing Instructions
- [ ] Compile `IntegratedPA_EA.mq5` in MetaEditor.
- [ ] Configure `NewsTimes` and `TradingSessions` inputs.
- [ ] Run the EA and observe `IntegratedPA_EA_log.csv` for session and news logs.

## Observations / Notes
- Logs trigger only when states change, reducing noise.
