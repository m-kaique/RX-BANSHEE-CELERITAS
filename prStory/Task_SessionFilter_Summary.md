# Task: SessionFilter
**Date:** 2025-06-13 18:20 UTC

## Problem
The EA opened new trades at any time. The trading guide recommends focusing on periods of higher liquidity and avoiding low-liquidity hours such as midday.

## Solution
Introduced a configurable session filter in `IntegratedPA_EA.mq5`. New input `TradingSessions` defines allowed time ranges (HH:MM-HH:MM). Functions parse these ranges and `IsTradingSession` blocks new orders outside them. This follows the guide's tip to "Concentrar operações nos períodos de maior liquidez" around lines 3159-3165 and to reduce trades during the lunch observation period (lines 5597-5604).

## Code (excerpt)
```mql5
input string TradingSessions = "09:00-12:00,14:00-17:00";
struct SessionRange { int start; int end; };

void ParseTradingSessions() { ... }
bool IsTradingSession() { ... }

void OnTick()
{
   g_exec.ManageOpenPositions(...);
   if(!IsTradingSession()) return;
   // signal generation and orders...
}
```

## Manual Testing Instructions
- [ ] Compile `IntegratedPA_EA.mq5`.
- [ ] Run in MetaTrader 5 and monitor logs. Confirm that new positions are only opened within the configured `TradingSessions` windows.
- [ ] Adjust `TradingSessions` to test different ranges.

## Observations / Notes
- Existing positions are still managed outside the trading windows.
- Updated delimiter in `ParseTradingSessions()` to use a character constant to avoid implicit conversion warnings during compilation.
