# Task: SpikeAndChannel Implementation
**Date:** 2025-06-13 04:19 UTC

## Problem
Spike and Channel detection was only a placeholder. The user requested using this strategy first before PullbackToMA.

## Solution
Implemented simplified Spike and Channel pattern detection based on the guide lines 3874-3884. The strategy looks for three consecutive strong bars in the same direction and generates a buy or sell signal with 2:1 reward. SignalEngine now evaluates SpikeAndChannel before PullbackToMA.

## Code
```mql5
// SignalEngine.mqh
SpikeAndChannel sac;
if(sac.Identify(symbol,tf))
    return sac.GenerateSignal(symbol,tf);

PullbackToMA pb;
if(pb.Identify(symbol,tf))
    return pb.GenerateSignal(symbol,tf);
```
Main parts of `SpikeAndChannel.mqh`:
```mql5
const int spikeBars = 3;
const double bodyFactor = 0.6;
// detection loops...
```

## Manual Testing Instructions
- [ ] Compile the EA in MetaEditor to ensure no errors.
- [ ] Attach EA to a chart and monitor log output for "SpikeChannel" signals.
- [ ] Enable trading on a demo account and verify orders follow the stop and target levels.

## Observations / Notes
- Pattern detection is simplified; improve with channel validation and volume filters from the guide.
- Risk parameters use a fixed 10-point buffer for stops.
