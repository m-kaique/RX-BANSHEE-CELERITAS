# Task: TrailingStopLoggingImprovement
**Date:** 2025-06-13 12:55

## Problem
The EA lacked detailed trade logging and used a simplistic trailing stop that didn't consider the current market phase, contrary to the trading guide which recommends adaptive management using indicators like VWAP/EMA and recent structure.

## Solution
- Extended `Logger` to also write CSV logs and added `LogSignal`/`LogTrade` methods (guide phase 2 logging recommendations).
- Added `AssetConfig` definition in `Defs.mqh` and updated modules to share this structure.
- Modified `TradeExecutor::ManageOpenPositions` to accept market context and adjust trailing stops:
  - In trending markets, the stop follows EMA20 with a small buffer.
  - In ranges or reversals, the stop trails recent highs/lows.
- Added VWAP calculation helper and context-based trailing logic as suggested around lines 3418-3424 of the guide.
- Signals and trade events are now logged via `Logger`.

## Code (excerpt)
```mql5
void ManageOpenPositions(MarketContext *ctx,const AssetConfig assets[],int count,ENUM_TIMEFRAMES tf)
{
    // ... after profit >=2R
    if(phase==PHASE_TREND)
        new_sl = (type==POSITION_TYPE_BUY)? MathMax(iLow(symbol,tf,1),GetEMA(symbol,tf,20)-5*point)
                                         : MathMin(iHigh(symbol,tf,1),GetEMA(symbol,tf,20)+5*point);
    else
        new_sl = (type==POSITION_TYPE_BUY)? iLow(symbol,tf,1)-5*point : iHigh(symbol,tf,1)+5*point;
    // modification logged through Logger
}
```

## Manual Testing Instructions
- [ ] Compile `IntegratedPA_EA.mq5` and ensure no compilation errors.
- [ ] Run the EA on demo charts enabling all assets and observe `*_log.csv` for entries of signals, orders, partials, and trailing adjustments.
- [ ] Verify trailing stops respect EMA20 during strong trends and recent bar highs/lows in ranges.

## Observations / Notes
- VWAP implementation is simplified and may differ from broker-provided VWAP.
- Logging to CSV uses common files so check terminal permissions if export fails.
